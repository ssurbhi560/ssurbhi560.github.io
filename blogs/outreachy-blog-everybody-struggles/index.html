The topic for this one is to write about something we are struggling with right now. With the work I have been doing for my project, there isn&rsquo;t anything I am struggling with right now, thanks to my awesome mentors and other wonderful folks at conda-forge, who are always there for any help.</p><p>The only thing that I am struggling with is writing these blogs. It has been more than a week since I started writing this blog, but I am still unable to finish it. The reason why it&rsquo;s taking me so long to write is because of the all the questions that come to my mind whenever I am writing any blog. Some of these questions are: <em>Is it really okay to share what I am writing? Am I sure that I am not writing something too personal? Is the language and way I have used for this blog okay? Would anyone even want to read this, is this really helpful?</em> and so on.</p><p>This has kept me from publishing many blogs that are still saved as drafts. And I think it is only natural to feel this way because every other day, I read one or more awesome blogs; hence, whenever I start writing one myself after that, I compare mine with the ones I read and feel &ldquo;not good enough&rdquo; again. The rational me tries to tell me that I would get better at writing only when I will write more, but the irrational and self-doubting me is also there who convinces me not to publish any blogs because these aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; and no one would like to read them, and this just goes on and on. Most of the time, I go with my irrational self. But only this time, I want the rational me to win, and therefore I have decided no matter how strongly I feel not to publish that blog, I will do it anyway. So, here is another blog post to make the rational me feel happy.</p><p>Another question we need to answer in this blog is an open-source vocabulary term that we once didn&rsquo;t know and eventually learned.</p><p>Recently, I learned about WYSIWYG editors, this might not be the open-source term, but when I first saw this, I couldn&rsquo;t think how I should even pronounce it. The next thing I did was a search for it and what I found interesting. WYSIWYG means <strong>What You See Is What You Get</strong> and is usually used to describe editing software.
