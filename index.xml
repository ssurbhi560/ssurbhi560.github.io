&lt;p>Hi, I am &lt;a href="https://github.com/ssurbhi560">Surbhi&lt;/a>, and this blog post is about the work I did over the last three most exciting months in my internship at Quansight Labs. My mentor during the internship was the very amazing &lt;a href="https://github.com/jaimergp">Jaime Rodríguez-Guerra&lt;/a>. The project I worked on during the internship was &lt;a href="https://github.com/conda-incubator/condacolab">condacolab&lt;/a>. We will shortly go into what &lt;code>condacolab&lt;/code> is, but before that, let&amp;rsquo;s understand a little about the two familiar names that we see here, which are &lt;strong>conda&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>colab&lt;/strong> and also why we needed &lt;code>condacolab&lt;/code> in the first place.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>RNN</title><link>https://ssurbhi560.github.io/notes/rnn-notes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ssurbhi560.github.io/notes/rnn-notes/</guid><description>&lt;p>rnnnnnnnnnn&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Outreachy Final wrap-up blog</title><link>https://ssurbhi560.github.io/blogs/outreachy-final-wrap-up-blog/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ssurbhi560.github.io/blogs/outreachy-final-wrap-up-blog/</guid><description>&lt;p>This blog is about my work during my Outreachy internship with &lt;a href="https://conda-forge.github.io">conda-forge&lt;/a>. Before that a little about me - I am &lt;a href="https://github.com/ssurbhi560">Surbhi&lt;/a>, an outreachy intern with conda-forge for the May-August 2022 cohort. I worked on documenting the conda-forge ecosystem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first issue I started working on when the internship began was &lt;a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/1611">Better anchoring of announcements(#1611)&lt;/a>. The goal of this issue was to fix the anchor for each year and also specific announcements in the Announcements section so as to provide better navigation of the &lt;a href="https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/announcements.html">Announcements page&lt;/a>. This was also the time when I was feeling quite overwhelmed and anxious since I was just starting and was unsure if I would be able to give my best. But thanks to my awesome mentors &lt;a href="https://github.com/kathatherine">@Katherine&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/beckermr">@Matt&lt;/a>, who have always been so helpful, I was able to have a good start. We solved this issue in two parts. The first part was to add anchors to each year which is solved with &lt;a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/pull/1766">Improve anchors for each year in the Announcements section. (#1766&lt;/a>), and the second part was adding anchors to each announcement and fixing the RSS feed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Outreachy mid-point project progress.</title><link>https://ssurbhi560.github.io/blogs/outreachy-mid-point-progress/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ssurbhi560.github.io/blogs/outreachy-mid-point-progress/</guid><description>&lt;p>This week marked the mid-point of my internship at conda-forge as an Outreachy intern.

&lt;p>Although if you have ended up here you might have read &lt;a href="https://ssurbhi560.github.io/about/">about me&lt;/a> on this website but, I will still briefly introduce myself:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am &lt;a href="https://github.com/ssurbhi560">Surbhi&lt;/a>, and I recently graduated from college where I completed BSc. (Honours) in Computer Applications after that, I worked at Pravatak Technologies Labs, IIT Madras as Project Associate. I was responsible for building a web application that could serve the &lt;a href="https://voila.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">voila&lt;/a> applications to users after proper authentication.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to setup ZNC bouncer!</title><link>https://ssurbhi560.github.io/blogs/how-to-setup-znc-bouncer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ssurbhi560.github.io/blogs/how-to-setup-znc-bouncer/</guid><description>&lt;p>After struggling for so many days today, finally, I could set up the ZNC bouncer. This blog post is about what steps I followed, the silly mistakes I made, and how I solved all of those.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But before proceeding to all that, let&amp;rsquo;s first see what ZNC bouncer is, what IRC is, and why everyone should try and use this awesome communication platform.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So let&amp;rsquo;s get started -
IRC is a platform for real-time communication for open source contributors but not just limited to them; and anyone can use it. It works on a client-server networking protocol. Various organizations offer IRC servers, and users have to use a client program to log in to the IRC servers. There are different IRC clients that one can use. I started using Hexchat, it&amp;rsquo;s beginner-friendly, and also, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty easy to navigate in it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Types of Programming languages</title><link>https://ssurbhi560.github.io/blogs/types-of-programming-languages/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ssurbhi560.github.io/blogs/types-of-programming-languages/</guid><description>&lt;p>There is no limit to the number of ways we can classify programming languages. Here, I will be trying to focus on one particular classification which is related to the way of declaration of the constructs in the language.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let’s start with discussing &lt;strong>statically typed language&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>dynamically typed language&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before diving in to understand these, first we need know &lt;em>what is type checking?&lt;/em> So, let&amp;rsquo;s read about that first.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Learnings from The Dip by Seth Godin</title><link>https://ssurbhi560.github.io/blogs/learning-from-the-dip-by-seth-godin/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ssurbhi560.github.io/blogs/learning-from-the-dip-by-seth-godin/</guid><description>&lt;p>When should you &lt;em>QUIT&lt;/em> something?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, I recently read &amp;lsquo;The Dip&amp;rsquo; by Seth Godin, and this blog is about what I learned from the book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcSm_vyI3pMiBqRnRgDNuV9lNlKJjKNUAu-O5smybljHs07Cgx9x" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s not a long book, and if you are an avid reader, it would hardly take a few hours. It focuses on &lt;em>QUITTING!!&lt;/em> A negative word, right?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No! In fact it is an essential thing that everyone should know &lt;strong>&amp;lsquo;when&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong> to do, if they want to save their precious time, resources and also wants to perform their best in whatever they do. This book will make you aware enough to decide &lt;strong>&amp;lsquo;when you need to quit?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>&amp;lsquo;when you need to stick?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
