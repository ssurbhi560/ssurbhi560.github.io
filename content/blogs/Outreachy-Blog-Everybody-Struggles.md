This is the second blog post in the series of Outreachy internship blogs I am writing. The topic for this one is to write about something we are struggling with right now. With the work I have been doing for my project, there isn't anything I am struggling with right now. Thanks to my awesome mentors and other wonderful folks at conda-forge, who are always there for help. 

The only thing that I am struggling with is writing these blogs. It has been more than a week since I started writing this blog, but I am still unable to finish it. The reason why it's taking me so long to write is because of all the questions that come to my mind whenever I am writing any blog. Some of these questions are:  *Is it really okay to share what I am writing? Am I sure that I am not writing something too personal? Is the language and way I have used for this blog okay? Would anyone even want to read this? Is this really helpful?* And so on.

This has kept me from publishing many blogs that are still saved as drafts. And I think it is only natural to feel this way because every other day, I read one or more awesome blogs; hence, whenever I start writing one myself after that, I compare mine with the ones I read and feel "not good enough" again. The rational me tries to tell me that I would get better at writing only when I will write more, but the irrational and self-doubting me is also there who convinces me not to publish any blogs because these aren't "good enough," and no one would like to read them, and this just goes on and on. Most of the time, I go with my irrational self. But only this time, I want the rational me to win, and therefore I have decided no matter how strongly I feel not to publish that blog, I will do it anyway. So, here is another blog post to make the rational me feel happy. 

Another question we need to answer in this blog is an open-source vocabulary term that we once didn't know and eventually learned.

Recently, I learned about WYSIWYG editors, this might not be the open-source term, but when I first saw this, I couldn't think how I should even pronounce it. The next thing I did was a search for it and what I found interesting. WYSIWYG means **What You See Is What You Get** and is usually used to describe editing software. You can read more about [WYSIWYG on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG).
