In this blog I would be sharing about my application journey and my core values.

Although if you have ended up here you might have read [about me](https://ssurbhi560.github.io/about) on this website, but still I will  briefly introduce myself: 

I am Surbhi, a recent graduate of BSc. (Honours) in Computer Applications. After college, I worked at [Pravatak Technologies Labs, IIT Madras](https://www.pravartak.org.in/) as Project Associate. I was responsible for building a web application that could serve the Jupyter notebook application using a tool [viola](https://voila.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). So, with this, users don't have to interact with the jupyter notebooks directly and thus helps them by not going through the hassle of learning it. 

I have mostly worked with Python and very little with Java. Currently, I am trying to improve my problem-solving skills, so I end up spending most of my free time on leetcode. 

My core values are Respect, Responsibility, and Kindness.

**Respect** - is one of the most important values for me. For every person, it is their right to be respected and their duty to respect others. Respect for an individual means that every person is of equal value, and there is no difference of any kind which could make someone more or less respectable. Everyone needs to respect others, but it is equally or sometimes even more important to respect yourself.

**Responsibility** - Being responsible becomes an unavoidable thing as we all grow older. Taking ownership of your work and life is not easy but very important to live a good and fulfilling life. When one is held answerable for their work, it helps them do the job with more precision and builds more self-confidence. I have always felt that taking responsibility has helped me be more serious with my work and perform better.

**Kindness** - is something that is most needed in the world we live in today. I believe a little more kindness from each of us can solve most of the big problems we have. Taking care and considering other people whenever we can not only help them but will also help us. I am still not good enough to say that kindness is my core value, but it is quite important for me. I would like it to be one of my core values some day in future, and till then, I will try to be more kind each day.
