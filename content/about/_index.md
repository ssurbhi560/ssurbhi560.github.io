I recently graduated from college, where I completed Bachelors of Science (Honours) in Computer Applications. I love to try out different technologies and tools. Currently, I am learning how to create scalable web applications and hence learning different web technologies.

I am also trying to contribute and become more familiar with open source software and communities behind some awesome projects. I plan to contribute more to open source and learn more about frontend development and web security in the future. Besides this, I am looking for internships and job opportunities. I am interested in web development and can pick up skills quickly, and also willing to dive deep into learning the requisite skills if the job provides the space to learn and grow.

## Experience

- ### **Software Engineer Intern - [Quansight](https://quansight.com/)**

- ### **Outreachy intern with [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/)**

    Worked on documenting conda-forge ecosystem and closed some important tickets improving documentation for maintainers and users contributing or using packages to/from conda-forge.

    [Worked on improving GitLab Wikis editing experience](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6312)

- ### **Project Associate - [Pravartak Technologies Labs, IIT Madras](https://www.pravartak.org.in/)**

    Build a web application that:
    - Lets users interact with the jupyter notebook application without serving the actual notebooks to users. Thus, providing easier usage and minimizing the complexity and learning curve for users.
    - Used Nginx reverse proxy to handle the requests to provide increased security, performance, and reliability.
