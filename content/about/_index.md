I am an aspiring software engineer and recently completed Bachelors of Science (Honours) in Computer Applications from [Aligarh Muslim University](https://www.amu.ac.in). I love to try out different technologies and tools. I am currently learning how to create scalable web applications and trying other web technologies. I have used Flask and Django for some personal projects.

I am also trying to contribute and become more familiar with open source software and communities behind some awesome projects. I plan to contribute more to open source and learn more about frontend development and web security in the future. Besides this, I am looking for internships and job opportunities. I am interested in web development and can pick up skills quickly; and also willing to dive deep into learning the requisite skills if the job provides the space to learn and grow.
