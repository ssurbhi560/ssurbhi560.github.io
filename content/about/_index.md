Hi, I'm Surbhi, a Dual Master's student in Computer Science and Journalism at Columbia University, specializing in Machine Learning. My research interests focus on natural language understanding and generation, and their applications in computational social science. I am also passionate about high-performance machine learning, optimizing large-scale models for practical deployment, and building responsible AI systems that enhance information accessibility, reliability, and informed decision-making.
